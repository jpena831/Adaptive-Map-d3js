		<h1>Equilibrium Equations for a Particle</h1>
				
		<p>If a body is in static equilibrium, then by definition that body is 
		not accelerating. If we know that the body is not accelerating then we 
		know that <strong>the sum of the forces acting on that body must be 
		equal to zero</strong>. This is the basis for the equations of equilibrium.</p>
		
		<p>We must also remember that forces are vectors, they have both a 
		magnitude and a direction. In order to add together the vectors we will 
		use the vector components in the x, y and sometimes z directions. To 
		ensure that the sum of the vectors is truly equal to zero, the sum of 
		the magnitudes of the components in any one direction must be equal to 
		zero. To solve the equilibrium equations we will break the single vector 
		equation (sum of forces is equal to zero) down into two scalar equations 
		for 2D problems (sum of the x components of the force vectors is equal 
		to zero, and sum of the y components of the force vectors is equal to 
		zero) or down into three scalar equations for 3D problems (sum of the x 
		components of the force vectors is equal to zero, sum of the y 
		components of the force vectors is equal to zero, and sum of the z 
		components of the force vectors is equal to zero).</p>

		<p>Once we have written out the equilibrium equations, we can solve the 
		equations for any unknown forces.</p>
		
		<h3>Finding the Equilibrium Equations:</h3>
		
		<p>The first step in finding the equilibrium equations is to draw a free 
		body diagram of the body being analyzed. This diagram should show all 
		the force vectors acting on the body. In the free body diagram, provide 
		values for any of the know magnitudes or directions for the force 
		vectors and provide variable names for any unknowns (either magnitudes 
		or directions).</p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="A free body diagram" height="272" src="images/freebodydiagram.png" width="600">
			<figcaption>The first step in equilibrium analysis is drawing a free 
			body diagram. This is done by removing everything but the body and 
			drawing in all forces acting on the body. It is also useful to label 
			all forces, key dimensions, and angles.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>Next you will need to chose the x, y, and z axes. These axes do need 
		to be perpendicular to one another, but they do not necessarily have to 
		be horizontal or vertical. If you choose coordinate axes that line up 
		with some of your force vectors you will simplify later analysis.</p>
		
		<p>Once you have chosen axes, you need to break down all of the force 
		vectors into components along the x, y and z directions (see the vector 
		decomposition page for more details on this process). Your first 
		equation will be the sum of the magnitudes of the components in the x 
		direction being equal to zero, the second equation will be the sum of 
		the magnitudes of the components in the y direction being equal to zero, 
		and the third (if you have a 3D problem) will be the sum of the 
		magnitudes in the z direction being equal to zero.</p>
		
		<p>Once you have your equilibrium equations, you can solve these 
		formulas for unknowns. The number of unknowns that you will be able to 
		solve for will be the number or equations that you have.</p>
		
		<h3>Particle vs. Extended Body Analysis:</h3>
		
		<p>In any body to be in equilibrium, the sum of the forces and the sum 
		of the moments has to be equal to zero. For a <strong>particle</strong>, 
		or for a <strong>concurrent force system</strong>, there will <strong>no 
		moments acting on the body</strong> though. For this reason the moment 
		equations will not be helpful for particles (the equation would end up 
		being zero is equal to zero). Therefore in particle analysis will rely 
		solely on the sum of the forces being equal to zero. When we start 
		analyzing extended bodies with non-concurrent forces we will begin to 
		encounter moments, and we will need to ensure the the sum of the moments 
		as well as the sum of the forces are equal to zero.</p>
