		<h1>Bodies and Free Body Diagrams</h1>
		
		<h2>Bodies:</h2>
		
		<p>A body, for the purposes of engineering mechanics, is a collection of 
		matter that is analyzed as a single object. This can be something simple 
		like a rubber ball, or it can be something made of many parts such as a 
		car. What can count as a body and what cannot count as a body is 
		dependent on the circumstances of the analysis. In some circumstances in 
		engineering mechanics, it is useful to make certain assumptions about 
		the bodies being analyzed. We will either need to assume the body is 
		either rigid or deformable, and we will need to assume that the body is 
		either a particle or an extended body.</p>
		
		<h3>Rigid versus Deformable Bodies</h3>
		
		<p>Rigid bodies do not deform (stretch, compress, or bend) when 
		subjected to loads, while deformable bodies do deform. In actuality, no 
		physical body is completely rigid, but many bodies deform so little that 
		this deformation has a minimal impact on the analysis. For this reason, 
		we usually assume that bodies in the statics and dynamics courses are 
		rigid. In the strengths of materials course we specifically remove this 
		assumption and examine how bodies deform and eventually fail under 
		loading.</p>
		<p>There is no set boundary for determining if a body can be 
		approximated as rigid, but there are two factors to to look for that 
		indicate that a rigid body assumption is not appropriate. First, if the 
		body is being visibly stretched, compressed, or bent during the period 
		of analysis, then the body should not be analyzed as a rigid body. 
		Second, if the body has parts that are free to move relative to one 
		another, then the body as a whole should not be analyzed as a rigid body 
		(this is instead an engineering structure, comprised of multiple 
		connected bodies that may be analyzed as rigid bodies individually).</p>

		<h3>Particles versus Extended Bodies:</h3>
		
		<p>Particles are bodies where all the mass is concentrated at a single 
		point in space. Particle analysis will only have to take into account 
		the forces acting on the body and translational motion. Extended bodies 
		on the other hand have mass that is distributed throughout a finite 
		volume. Extended body analysis is more complex and also has to take into 
		account moments and rotational motions. In actuality, no bodies are 
		truly particles, but some bodies can be approximated as particles to 
		simplify analysis. Bodies are often assumed to be particles if the 
		rotational motions are negligible when compared to the translational 
		motions, or in systems where there is no moment exerted on the body such 
		as a concurrent force system.</p>

		<h2>Free Body Diagrams:</h2>
		
		<p>A free body diagram is a tool used to solve engineering mechanics 
		problems. As the name indicates, the point of the diagram is to "free" 
		the body being analyzed from all other objects and surfaces so that the 
		forces and moments acting directly on that body can be analyzed. The 
		diagram below shows a ladder and the free body diagram of that ladder. 
		As you can see, the ladder is separated from all other objects and all 
		forces acting on the ladder are drawn in.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="" height="350" src="images/freebodydiagram.jpg" 
			width="500">
			<figcaption>The diagram above shows a ladder being used by a person 
			with all the surroundings to the left and the free body diagram of 
			the ladder to the right</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>To draw a free body diagram:</p>
		
		<ol>
		<li>First draw the body being analyzed. Only draw in the body being analyzed, do not draw any other bodies or surfaces.</li>
		<li>Second, draw in all forces and moments acting directly on the body. 
		Only include forces and moments that are directly applied to the body, 
		do not include forces acting on other bodies. Some types of forces to 
		look for are:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Gravitational Forces:</strong> Unless otherwise noted, the 
				mass of an object will result in a weight force applied to the 
				center of mass of the body.</li>
				<li><strong>Normal Forces: </strong>Every object in direct contact with 
				the body will exert a normal force on that body which prevents 
				the two objects from occupying the same space at the same time. 
				Note that only objects in direct contact can exert normal forces 
				on the body. Joints or bearings connecting the body to other 
				objects will also exert normal forces on the body.</li>
				<li><strong>Friction Forces:</strong> Objects in direct contact with the 
				body can exert friction forces on the body, which will resist 
				the two bodies sliding against one another.</li>
				<li><strong>Tension in Cables:</strong> Cables, wires or ropes attached to 
				the body will exert a tension force on the body in the direction 
				of the cable.</li>
				<li>The above forces are the most common, but other forces such 
				as pressure from fluids, spring forces and magnetic forces may 
				exist and may act on the body.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		</ol>
