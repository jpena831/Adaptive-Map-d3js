<h2>About the Adaptive Map Tool:</h2>

<p>The Adaptive Map tool aims to enhance learning by providing advance 
organizers, in the form of expert generated concept maps, to the user. This is 
realized through the concept map based navigation system that is central to the 
design of the Adaptive Map software. By providing an advance organizer (a high 
level, easy to understand, overview of the information) the tool subtly 
encourages the user to keep the big picture in mind, helping users connect new 
information to previously learned topics.</p>

<p>Because concept maps can become overwhelming when they become too large, the 
interactive navigation system is also designed to adapt the visuals to the 
user's current focus. This ensures that the user gets a relevant overview of the 
information they are currently examining, but that they not visually overwhelmed 
with irrelevant details.</p>
	
<p>The tool has been tested in the classroom and was shown to be more effective 
than a traditional paper textbook in two respects. First, as predicted with the 
design, the tool encourages users to spend more time attending to an overview of 
the information, helping students build a skeleton they can fit details into 
later. Second, the tool encouraged users to step back and review topics from 
previous sections that were relevant to the topics they were learning. This 
combination of behaviors in the users leads to greater measures of conceptual 
understanding, with little to no extra effort on the part of the learner.</p>
